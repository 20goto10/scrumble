scrumble
========

A simple Google hangout app that randomize the order of presenters for collaborative teams. It can also send an alarm to remind visitors that it's Scrum Time.

This Hangout plugin relies on having a Hipchat room and a Hipchat API key.

Blahblah
========

Believe it or not, there's no Hangout API interface for connecting to
gchat. 

Scrumble saves your room name, hipchat key, and alarm image as cookies
so you can retrieve them next to you reload.
